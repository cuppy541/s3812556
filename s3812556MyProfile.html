  <p>Student number: S3812556<p>
    <p>Email: S3812556@student.rmit.edu.au<p>
        <p>My name is Jamie I was born in and live in Launceston, Tasmania with my partner Emma and my golden retriever Baylee. I have completed up to year 11 at St Patricks college in Launceston. I joined the military in 2009 and completed several courses like multi-combination truck licence and heavy towing and salvage certification. I did 7 years of service there, meeting a lot of friends and forming some family bonds with people I could never lose. After my service I came back home to Tasmania where I met my partner Emma. I work as a truck driver at Toll and I really enjoy long distant drives I get to make every day. Some interests of mine including playing video games like World of Warcraft and Dota 2 and playing rugby for the Launceston Tigers. </p>

      <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
      <p>What is your interest in I.T.? My interest stemmed back when I was a kid and my cousin taught me how to build computers from parts we got from markets. But now my interests are how and what helps them components talk to each other, how words transform into beautiful websites, stunning video games and applications. I only have a small amount of experience in HTML from when I was in school. My experience is much better on the hardware side of I.T. like building computers and setting up networks.<p>
        <p>Since I have been out of the military, I have always wanted to go to university but since I had not received an ATAR score I thought I had no chance of being accepted, Plus I work full time and it was going to be very hard to study and work full time. One day I was scrolling through Facebook I seen an advertisement for open Universities Australia saying you could study I.T. online, so I clicked the link and then it came to choose who I wanted to study through. I see RMIT and thought who else would be better at teaching me I.T. than the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. Then to see that they offered exactly what I wanted to do so I applied.<p>
          <p>By the end of my Bachelor of Information Technology. I would like to have a firm grasp of all the different areas of I.T. With choosing the majors that I would like to complete; I would like to have more than common knowledge of two areas of I.T. and they would be programming and web design. I would like to learn to program software, I like the idea of writing out all these words that make no sense to most people then to make something so important to just one small person or lots of people all around the world. Then there is web design, one thing I would like to get out of I.T. is to make a beautiful yet functional website for someone, so that they could use for a personal blog or a small business. <p>

<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39845477?searchrequesttoken=1748d744-2c37-4c18-a36e-0510d0ad8777&type=standout">click here</a><p>to see the job i would like in the future<p>
  <p>This job to me is a position at a company where teamwork is key. As a full-stack developer you need to be able to design brilliant looking websites on the front-end, then go and write the code for the backend of the very functional website. It is appealing to me because this is what I want to do when I finish university. Make something that looks appealing to people but easy to use and navigate, just to make their day easier. In this job you are required to use a verity of different tools such as HTML, bootstrap and CSS. So, experience in these fields is a must. You must be able to demonstrate to this company that you have said experience in these fields. You must also have great teamwork so you can collaborate with your fellow co-workers on ideas and designs. As this is a field where I have not studied yet I have a little knowledge of HTML and CSS designing using Adobe Dreamweaver. In saying that I do have the required teamworking skills needed for this position from working in the military. To be able to eventually get this position I first need to study web design as much as I can in university, leading from that I would to get a position as a web design graduate, working on small projects. Where I would gain experience and hopefully move into a junior web designing position. After a few more years of experience working with a small team and demonstrating leadership skills I would apply for this position above.<p>

    <p>These results for me are not what I was expecting, they show that I like to lead people, most likely in a team.  Like inspiring them to do a good job and encouraging them. In my current workplace I do like guiding people to strive for their best. In a group setting I can help by maybe acting as the leader, handing our specific task that that member might like to complete. Maybe if the team member is struggling with their part of our project, I could encourage them to get back up and try again to achieve something together as a team. When forming a team, a team I would hopefully try to find people that don’t mind me taking charge a little, not too much as in a want to be the one throwing the orders around. But maybe the one who can encourage the members around to strive for their best while I do the same with the work I need to complete.<p>

<p>These result show that I am more inclined to really listen to things and make sense of stuff rather than looking at something and remembering it. But as the results show I am really not that one sided to auditory, it shows I have a good mix of learning styles that I would have to put together in order to remember stuff and take it all in. in a team based scenario it would be more beneficial if we were to collaborate on a personal setting either in person or on a skype call. But also show chatting via an application like discord would not be out of reach for my learning styles. When forming a team, I would be better for me if people were not so shy when it comes to talking about a project or just talking in general. But if need be I can adapt and collaborate with them by text.<p>
<a href="Learning Style_ The Results.pdf">click here for results</a>
<p>With this test I carried out, it shows that I like to be busy a lot more than other people, taking a lot of information in and trying to process it all at once. It also shows that I most likely cannot take one side of most things till I know the definitive truth, but I still have a bit of curiosity, trying to think outside the box on a problem or going outside the box to get a conclusion. I think with this one when forming a group, it will be hard because If I have two people with different ideas for the same problem, I might not be able to choose which one I go with.<p>

<h1>Project idea<h1>

</div>

<p>My idea for an I.T. project is an extension to the current application and addon service twitch. I would like to see an in-game overlay system where I can look for addon or mods. install them, uninstall them and with just a reload of the UI have them up and running in seconds. You could also use it for writing down some notes if you are a content creator for the site and have an idea mid game for a mod or addon and you don’t want to forget it. <p>
  <p>I can’t say that I can give much statistics on this idea because I haven’t really seen or heard anyone complain about the problem. But there is nothing worse than having to exit a game completely to add a mod or add-on. Most add-ons are just UI changes so if you just reload the UI in world of warcraft for example you should be able to see the new add-on you just installed. Just like a smartphone, installing applications does not require to restart the phone. So just a little add-on to a game should not require you to close the game completely.<p>
    <p>Above was a Picture on the current steam overlay and a few features it has. Now twitch already has an overlay system but it is only for streamers to have customs things over their stream for viewer to see. So, I would like to have one for add-ons and mods, that we can use while playing a game and not switching out windows to go to it. Features I would like to see would be;<li>Clean easy to use overlay UI.</li>
<li>Add-on/mods finder.</li>
<li>Social tab to talk to friends not in game.</li>
<li>Forum tab to see what people are saying about the game you are in.</li>
<li>Creators pages, to submit bugs or to provide feedback.</li>
Seeing some of the features I would like to see in the overlay, I will now go into each topic in more detail. I would like the UI to be clean and easy to use. It would need to be slightly transparent as to still see what is going on in-game. At the top you would have tabs going from left to right displaying the different categories such as home, add-ons, social, forums, feedback and help. The home tab would just have an overview of all recent activity. The colour theme would still be the twitch purple but a little transparent to make it look more of a lavender colour. The add-ons tab would have your usual search, browse, top add-ons trending and paid if they wanted to go down that route. If you are using this overlay, you would most likely know what add-ons your looking for so having the search button first would just be easier. The social tab would have your friends online and who is offline, you will be able to click onto your friend’s name and talk to them via private message. You will also be able to view your friend’s profile as well.  The forum tab will be simple with a search button and a create button, it would also have a trending and new part of the page with about the 10 of each on the page. The last tab would be where you search and see creator’s pages that have all their add-ons so you can provide feedback or even submit bugs/problems with the addons they are providing. You will be able to activate the overlay via a keystroke of your choosing.
<p>
  <p>You will not need much hardware apart from a keyboard to put the keystroke into to activate the overlay and maybe a few computers to put input the code. My idea is just about adding to already built software. Twitch and if they still use curse’s software all they would need to do is open their source code and add the code for the add-ons overlay.<p>
    <p>The core software is already built being twitch. The software that needs to be made is more of an extension. From what I can recall I have not been a part of a project before, but from what I can tell some of the roles and skill required for my project would include a project manager, a chief technology officer, 1-3 senior software developers, 1-5 junior software developers, some testers and a maintenance crew for ongoing support to this software. In twitch’s pool of staff members, it would be very feasible to get the job done and make this come to life.<p>
      <p>If my project idea was successful, I believe it would be a very beneficial addiction to an already growing company and its users. Being able to add add-ons on the fly, talk to content creators and provide feed and also search forums all without alt tabbing out of game. I believe it if was to be created it would have a welcoming reception to the users of Twitch and Curse. The impact it would have on me would be high one. I am always installing and uninstall add-ons and mods to suite my gameplay at the time. So being able to do that with a smart overlay I think would improve my gameplay slightly.<p>
